Revelation 2.0
==============

<feature> 	: added pseudo random encoding of the data within the stego image. This spreads the data (seemingly) randomly over the stego image to achieve a more natural image. Also makes cryptanalysis harder, as the order is now obfuscated
<fix>		: fixed the encoding of the bottom line of pixels, in Revelation 1.0, these were wrapped 1 pixel left
<fix>		: changed the HTML in the popup help files to be HTML 3.2 compliant (JEditorPane supports up to HTML 3.2 only)


Revelation 1.0
==============

<feature>	: adaptive embedding, Revelation will automatically choose the minimum number of LSB's to modify on the source image in order to fully hide the data (from 1 -> 4 LSB's)
<feature>	: minimum error replacement
<feature>	: unique wizard style interface
<feature>	: help with every step
